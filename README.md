# Leveraging Big Data for Business Intelligence

Between January 2024 and March 2024 I enrolled onto the 'Leveraging Big Data for Business Intelligence' 6 week course provided by University of Cambridge Online.

This main learning outputs of this course are:
- communicate data-driven decisions with authority to key stakeholders
- determine the main components of Big Data, Data Science and Machine Learning and how they work in a practical web tech environment
- undertake data analysis, data cleansing and data visualisation for data-driven product development to resolve strategic business issues
- interpret what the tools are telling you in terms of data trends and how to modify your approach
- strategically apply a range of data tools and methods to analyse and resolve common business issues.

Utilising Google BigQuery and Colab Notebook. the teachings of this course culminated in a final assignment supposing that we are a product owner for a car insuance company and need to predict the the number of collisions on any given day of the week for New York taxis.
